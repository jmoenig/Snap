ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.buildContents - add a source button for git
ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.setSource - add a case for 'git'
Somewhere, we need to ask for (and display) the repo url
Then we read the entire repo and show any xml files?  (name = path within the repo/name.xml)

https://github.com/wcyuan/snap-github/blob/master/cloud.js

Make look like cloud.

Possible designs:
 A - provide github repo when you open, repo/user/pass when you save
   - prompt the user with pop-ups every time?
     - or try to remember it, but then need a way for the user to change them
   - remove the share button from the open dialog
 B - have a separate place where you can set the repo and provide user/pass, put it where you login to snap

 How do we send or save the password, is it plaintext?  Hash it?

Todo:
 - show files in all sub-directories of the repo
 - only show xml files
 - when saving, only provide username/repo once
 - fix error related to having no preview
 - handle github pagination
 - handle delete
 - handle save (instead of save as)
 - add to snap-fast.html
 - allow staying logged in on this computer until logged out (?)

Done:
 - have the user provide the github username and repo name
