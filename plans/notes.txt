ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.buildContents - add a source button for git
ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.setSource - add a case for 'git'
Somewhere, we need to ask for (and display) the repo url
Then we read the entire repo and show any xml files?  (name = path within the repo/name.xml)

Make look like cloud.

Possible designs:
 A - provide github repo when you open, repo/user/pass when you save
 B - have a separate place where you can set the repo and provide user/pass, put it where you login to snap
