ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.buildContents - add a source button for git
ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.setSource - add a case for 'git'
Somewhere, we need to ask for (and display) the repo url
Then we read the entire repo and show any xml files?  (name = path within the repo/name.xml)

https://github.com/wcyuan/snap-github/blob/master/cloud.js

Make look like cloud.

"saveProjectToCloud" = save
"saveCloudProject" = saveAs

Possible designs:
 A - provide github repo when you open, repo/user/pass when you save
   - prompt the user with pop-ups every time?
     - or try to remember it, but then need a way for the user to change them
   - remove the share button from the open dialog
 B - have a separate place where you can set the repo and provide user/pass, put it where you login to snap

 How do we send or save the password, is it plaintext?  Hash it?

save as:
  - opens the Save As dialog
  - user clicks 'setSource' (if necessary)
  - this prompts for username / repo
    - SnapGithub.promptRepoGetProjectList
      - saves the lastUser and lastRepo in SnapGithub object
  - user clicks 'save'
  - calls saveProject
  - calls saveGithubProjectWithList (with the project list)
  - this checks the project list to see if the project with that name already exists
    - if so, prompts the user to confirm overwrite
    - also saves the sha
  - saveAsGithubProject
    - SnapGithub.promptPasswordSaveProject (prompts for password only)
      - reuses the lastUser and lastRepo in SnapGithub object


save:
  - user clicks save, doesn't open any dialog
  - calls saveGithubProjectNoList (with the project list)
    - gets the project list
    - calls SnapGithub.maybePromptGetProjectList
      - if name, lastUser and lastRepo are not set, prompts for everything
        - SnapGithub.promptRepoPasswordSaveProject
      - otherwise, reuses lastUser and lastRepo to download the project list
      	- once it has the list, (re)uses saveGithubProjectWithList
	  which will prompt for the password
	- actually, this branch almost never happens because the only ways
	  that set the source to github also set lastUser and lastRepo

Todo:
 [-] show files in all sub-directories of the repo (?)
   [x] add "path" as a separate variable aside from repo
   [x] default to "/"
   [ ] would be better to be able to traverse directories properly
       [ ] if user selects a directory, it just refreshes the project list
       [ ] subdirectories need a way to go up
   [ ] no nice way to add a new folder, but you can currently do it if you
       save a project as "directory/name"
 [x] remember username/repo, and provide a button to change repo
 [x] when source=github, remove "share" button
 [ ] handle delete project
   [x] until it's ready, remove the "delete" button
 [ ] only show xml files
 [ ] show last modified time

 [ ] handle github pagination
 [ ] handle github 2-factor auth
 [ ] add to snap-fast.html
