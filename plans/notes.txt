ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.buildContents - add a source button for git
ProjectDialogMorph.prototype.setSource - add a case for 'git'
Somewhere, we need to ask for (and display) the repo url
Then we read the entire repo and show any xml files?  (name = path within the repo/name.xml)

https://github.com/wcyuan/snap-github/blob/master/cloud.js

Make look like cloud.

"saveProjectToCloud" = save
"saveCloudProject" = saveAs

Possible designs:
 A - provide github repo when you open, repo/user/pass when you save
   - prompt the user with pop-ups every time?
     - or try to remember it, but then need a way for the user to change them
   - remove the share button from the open dialog
 B - have a separate place where you can set the repo and provide user/pass, put it where you login to snap

 How do we send or save the password, is it plaintext?  Hash it?

save as:
  - opens the Save As dialog
  - user clicks 'setSource' (if necessary)
  - this prompts for username / repo
    - SnapGithub.promptRepoGetProjectList
      - saves the lastUser and lastRepo in SnapGithub object
  - user clicks 'save'
  - calls saveProject
  - calls saveGithubProjectWithList (with the project list)
  - this checks the project list to see if the project with that name already exists
    - if so, prompts the user to confirm overwrite
    - also saves the sha
  - saveAsGithubProject
    - SnapGithub.promptPasswordSaveProject (prompts for password only)
      - reuses the lastUser and lastRepo in SnapGithub object


save:
  - user clicks save, doesn't open any dialog
  - calls saveGithubProjectNoList (with the project list)
    - gets the project list
    - calls SnapGithub.maybePromptGetProjectList
      - if name, lastUser and lastRepo are not set, prompts for everything
        - SnapGithub.promptRepoPasswordSaveProject
      - otherwise, reuses lastUser and lastRepo to download the project list
      	- once it has the list, (re)uses saveGithubProjectWithList
	  which will prompt for the password
	- actually, this branch almost never happens because the only ways
	  that set the source to github also set lastUser and lastRepo

Todo:
 [ ] handle github 2-factor auth
 [ ] handle non-master branches
 [ ] fix buttons on open/save github (they need more space, currently they collide with
     the source buttons)
 [ ] remove the preview / notes / last modified time in the open/save dialog for github
 [ ] turn github on and off in settings?  A little weird
     because I think those are saved with the project, right?
 [ ] localize strings, add icons
 [ ] add a way to include the repo in a link so you can send someone a link to your snap projects
   [ ] if you are given a #run or #present, and the file is on github, extract the
       username, repo, and path from it?
 [ ] handle github pagination
 [ ] add a way to add a new folder
     - you can currently do it if you save a project as "directory/name"
 [ ] add a way to create a new repository?

Done:
 [-] show files in all sub-directories of the repo (?)
   [x] add "path" as a separate variable aside from repo
   [x] default to "/"
   [-] would be better to be able to traverse directories properly
       [x] if user selects a directory, it just refreshes the project list
       [x] subdirectories need a way to go up
       [-] at that point, remove path as a separate input?  Or I guess it's fine to leave it
 [x] remember username/repo, and provide a button to change repo
 [x] when source=github, remove "share" button
 [x] only show xml files
 [x] until delete is ready, remove the "delete" button for github
 [x] add to snap_fast.html
 [x] Fix double-clicking on directories in the ProjectDialogMorph
     Currently it just closes the dialog because DialogBoxMorph.prototype.accept
     ends with this.destroy();
 [x] button alignment on ProjectDialogMorph gets screwed up when
     you switch from github back to local
 [x] allow user to specify a commit message
 [x] handle delete project
