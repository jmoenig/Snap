Add a reference to \n**/dronestream/nodecopter-client.js** in your template. Then attach the stream to a DOM node:\n```html\n<!-- on the client -->\n<script src=\"/dronestream/nodecopter-client.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // video canvas will auto-size to the DOM-node, or default to 640*360 if no size is set.\n  new NodecopterStream(document.getElementById(\"droneStream\"));\n</script>\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe drone sends a proprietary video feed on 192.168.1.1 port 5555. This is\nmostly a h264 baseline video, but adds custom framing. These frames are parsed\nand mostly disposed of. The remaining h264 payload is split into NAL units and\nsent to the browser via web sockets.\n\nIn the browser broadway takes care of the rendering of the WebGL canvas.\n\n## Status\n\nNode-dronestream has gained some stability in the last release. It attempts \nto recover lost connections to the drone, and it handles multiple clients, \ndisconnections, etc. See \"How to use\" for API.\n\n## Thanks\n\n- Triple high fives to Felix 'felixge' Geisendörfer for getting the whole\n  NodeCopter movement started and being extremely helpful in the process of\n  getting this together.\n\n- André 'zoddy' Kussmann for supplying the drone and allowing me to keep\n  hacking on it, even when he had to cancel the NodeCopter event for himself.\n\n- Michael Bebenita, Alon Zakai, Andreas Gal and Mathieu 'p01' Henri for the\n  magic of Broadway.js\n\n- Johann Phillip Strathausen for being a great team mate at NodeCopter 2012\n  Berlin.\n\n- Brian Leroux for being not content with the original solution and for\n  cleaning up the predecessor, nodecopter-stream.\n\n- @karlwestin for picking up where I was to lazy to actually make this usable.\n\n## Demo\n\nWatch @felixge demoing node-dronestream live at german user group cgnjs:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwGNNMJt4mE&t=19m52\n",
