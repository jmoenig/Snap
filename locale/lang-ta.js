The remaining three inputs are used only if the field values are numbers, in which case they can be grouped into buckets (e.g., decades, centuries, etc.). Those three inputs specify the smallest and largest values of interest and, most importantly, the width of a bucket (10 for decades, 100 for centuries). If the field isn't numeric, leave these three inputs empty or set them to zero. In that case, each string value of the field is its own bucket, and they appear sorted alphabetically. The block reports a new table with three columns. The first column contains the bucket name or smallest number. The second column contains a nonnegative integer that says how many records in the input table fall into this bucket. The third column is a subtable containing the actual records from the original table that fall into the bucket. If your buckets aren't of constant width, or you want to group by some function of more than one field, load the \"Frequency Distribution Analysis\" library instead.": "",
