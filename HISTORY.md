# Snap! (BYOB) History

## in development:
* **New Features:**
    * new "this" reporter for introspection offering access to "script", "caller", "continuation" and "inputs", enabling programs to access their dynamic scope and runtime call-stack
    * "call" is now hyperized and accepts a list/table etc. of rings as procedure input, returns a list/table etc. of applying all arguments to each ring. Currently constrained to primitive data (text, number, Boolean) inputs, albeit in any dimension (e.g. lists of lists of data)
    * new "sorted" and "shuffled" selectors in list properties reporter's dropdown
    * new "stage", "agent" and "script" selectors in "is a?" reporter's dropdown
    * new "case sensitivity" preference setting
    * new "case sensitivity" selector to the setting blocks' dropdowns 
    * new dropdown menu with "length", "lower case" and "upper case" selectors in the "length of text" reporter
    * new option to make individual input slots in custom blocks "static", i.e. irreplaceable by reporters
    * new option to specify a "separator" (infix) label for variadic input slots inside custom blocks
    * new "generate puzzle" feature - single click Parson's Puzzle generator for educators
    * new "Sarron" costume series, thanks, Meghan and Brian!
    * new Armenian translation, yay! Thanks to the contributors!
    * new embedding configuration options: noSpriteEdits
    * Expanded the `#open:` URL scheme to accept image URLs.
    * new "ide_translation_dict", "ide_set_translation_dict(data)" and "txt_export(txt, name)" extension primitives
* **Notable Changes:**
    * IF is now variadic and expandable with "else if" cases
    * explicit variadic input list visuals
    * "this script" reporter has been morphed into the new general "this" introspection/self reflection reporter
    * RUN/CC and CALL/CC primitives have been deprecated and removed from the palette, will still be present and work in existing projects
    * changed the first input slot of the "reshape" block from "list" type to "any" type
    * changed JOIN, APPEND and COMBINATIONS to show "with" infix label in between inputs, and to collapse from 2 inputs directly to "input list" case, same as +, min, AND etc. (monadic uses in existing projects will not change) 
    * improved browser resource management for graphics and sounds
    * changed long-form input dialog setting's behavior to automatically expand / collapse slot type view
    * slightly optimized pen drawing performance when WARPed
    * removed multibranched conditional library (cases.xml), because IF is now variadic
    * updated audio comp library with a faster (hyper) version of the "Hz for secs" reporter
    * updated animation library with a faster (hyper) version of "glide" and added "steps" selector to the "animate" command
    * new "fade-in" block in the audio comp library lets you reduce audible "clicks" in sounds computed from raw samples
    * messages and identifying sprites, costumes and sounds by their names is now case-insensitive by default (e.g. in "object", "broadcast", "of" blocks)
    * translations now use abstract block specs
    * updated the strings library for and with the new case sensitivity and lower case primitives
    * generated JSON strings are now (somewhat) pretty printed (with newlines and indentations)
    * increased arrows heads size for variadic inputs and dropdown menus
* **Notable Fixes:**
    * fixed #3154 (let "this script" capture variables in rings)
    * catch misspelled or non-existing translation keys in urls and elsewhere, thanks, Joan!
    * fixed a bug that led to the default input of "When I am clicked" not being translated
    * fixed serializing complex inputs to contexts (procedure objects)
    * fixed #3207 (initial arrow head orientation for long form input slot dialog)
    * fixed a number/text type glitch in the "(ray length) TO (sprite)" reporter for hyperized angular offsets
    * fixed #3180 (preserve zero values in blockified lists instead of turning them into empty slots)
    * fixed stopping ASK prompter under certain race conditions
    * fixed MAP, KEEP, FIND and COMBINE primitives to work with JS-funargs
    * fixed assigning same costume names to recurrent video snaps
    * fixed sound naming rules for same-named imports
