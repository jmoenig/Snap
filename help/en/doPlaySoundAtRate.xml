                A higher sampling rate will take less time to finish the
                sound, but will make it higher pitched (squeakier).
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, a lower sampling rate will slow down the sound,
                but also make it lower pitched (deeper).

                Most sounds have a natural sampling rate of 44100 Hz (44.1
                kHz), because that's the rate at which CDs are made.
            </p>
            <p>
                The highest pitch that can be included in a sound is just
                under half the sampling rate, so CDs can reproduce up to 20
                kHz, which is about the limit of human hearing.
