            <p>
                The video layer is in front of the background, but behind
                everything else. If, as usual, the stage background is solid
                white, this just “ghosts” the video. If you have another
                background, then dimming the video undims the background and
                vice versa. Sprites and pen trails are always in front of the
                video.
