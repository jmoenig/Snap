                    Create a clone of the selected sprite, with the same
                    position, direction, costumes, sounds, local variables,
                    local blocks, and scripts. Most of these properties are
                    shared with the original, so that a change in the
                    original changes the clone, but not the other way around.
                    Temporary clones are deleted when the stop button

                    The clone will not be visible immediately because it is
                    in exactly the same position as the original! See the

                Note: Snap! clones are not copies of the sprite; they
                actually share information, so a change in the original may
                be seen in the clones. See the “Object Oriented Porgramming
                with Sprites” chapter in the Snap! Reference Manual.
