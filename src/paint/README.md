    Nathan Dinsmore contributed a fully working prototype,
    Nathan's brilliant flood-fill tool has been more or less
    directly imported into this paint implementation.

    Jens MÃ¶nig has contributed icons and bugfixes and says he has probably
    introduced many other bugs in that process. :-)
