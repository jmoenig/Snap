If you think you've found a bug in Snap!, [ask in **the Snap! forum**](http://snapforum.cs10.org/t/about-bugs-development) to confirm whether it's a known bug (or just a mistake in your project!).

Make sure you include:

* What the bug is
* How to trigger it
* Your browser & computer (eg. Chrome on Mac OS X)

Once others have confirmed the bug, they'll help you report it here.

Thanks for your interest in Snap! :-)
