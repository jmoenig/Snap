BeetleBlocks is a visual, blocks-based programming environment for
3D design and fabrication. BeetleBlocks programs move a graphical
"beetle" around a 3D world, where it can place 3D shapes, extrude 
its path as a tube, and generate geometry in other ways. The
resulting 3D geometry can be exported as a 3D-printable file.

BeetleBlocks is a project by Eric Rosenbaum and Duks Koschitz, 
with software development by Bernat Romagosa and Jens Moenig.
