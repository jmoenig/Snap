### [Run ![Snap-Logo](snap_logo_sm.png) now!][run]

## Getting Started With Snap<em>!</em>
To start using Snap<em>!</em> we recommend you just [jump in][run]! (There is also a very handy [manual][manual] available.)

To get started with development, you should take a look at the [contributing][contrib] file, though it is currently a bit out of date.  Each file in the Snap<em>!</em> source is well documented with comments and a beginning introduction. You may also find [this discussion][overview] helpful. If you are interested in fixing a particular issue, feel free to comment on that thread.

Snap<em>!</em> is currently available in **34** different languages! If you'd like to help translate Snap<em>!</em> to a new language, or improve an existing translation, please take a look at the [translations guide][translation].

## About Snap<em>!</em>
_Note_: This section is just a stub. It will eventually cover:

* saving, loading, exporting, importing
* artefacts: projects, blocks, sprites
* URL options: #run: #open: #lang: #signup
* dynamic content (currently deactivated):
	* http://snap.berkeley.edu/cloudmsg.txt
	* http://snap.berkeley.edu/motd.txt
* supported browsers, problems with the Android virtual keyboard
* supported browser / OS settings
* SVG support limitations
* OS/X: turn LCD font smoothing off
* Beware of third-party Chrome toolbars and iFrames

## Getting In Touch
There are a few main places the Snap<em>!</em> team hangs around.

* The [Github Issues Tracker][gh-issues] is used for bugs, and support questions. If you have encountered a bug, please search here to see if others have had similar experiences.
* There is a user-centered [discussion thread][user-thread] on the Scratch forums.
* There is also a [development thread][dev-thread] on the Scratch forums.
