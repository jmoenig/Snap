iteration-composition.xml	Iteration, composition	Traditional loop constructs (while, until, etc.) plus the Lisp "named let" (a generalization of FOR) plus functional iteration (repeated invocation of a function) and function composition.
list-utilities.xml	List utilities	Some standard functions on lists (reverse, sort, etc.)
colors.xml	Colors and Crayons	Incorporates the former crayon and set RGB libraries.  Implements fair hues (more orange, less green, adds brown) and a linear color scale including grayscale and fair-hue-based shades.
bignumbers.xml	Bignums, rationals, complex #s	The full Scheme numeric tower.  "USE BIGNUMS <True>" to enable.
cases.xml	Multi-branched conditional	Like "switch" in C-like languages or "cond" in Lisp.  Thanks to Nathan Dinsmore for inventing the idea of a separate block for each branch!
try-catch.xml	Catch errors	Run a script; if an error happens, instead of stopping the script with a red halo, run another script to handle the error. Also includes a block to cause an error with a message given as input. Also includes a block to create a script variable and give it a value.
parallel_module.xml	Parallelization	Run several scripts in parallel and wait until all are done.
Eisenbergification.xml	Getters and setters	Eisenberg's Law: Anything that can be done from the GUI should be doable from the programming language, and vice versa.
variadic-reporters.xml	Variadic reporters	Versions of +, x, AND, and OR that take more than two inputs.

maps_module.xml	World Map	Add interactive maps to projects
textCostumes_module.xml	Text Costumes	Generate costumes from letters or words of text.
speech_module.xml	Text to Speech	Output text using speech synthesis.
animation_module.xml	Animation	Glide, grow and rotate using easing functions.
pixel_module.xml	Pixels	Manipulate costumes pixel-wise.
audioComp_module.xml	Audio Comp	Analyze, manipulate and generate sound samples.
frequency_distribution_module.xml	Frequency Distribution Analysis	Analyze data for frequency distribution
localstorage_module.xml	Database	Persistent key-value storage across Snap! sessions in the same browser

word-sentence.xml	Words, sentences	One of the big ideas in Logo that they left out of Scratch is thinking of text as structured into words and sentences, rather than just a string of characters.  This library brings back that idea.
strings.xml	Strings, Multi-line input	Extract substrings of a string in various ways. In general, text inputs allow only a single line.  The MULTILINE block accepts multi-line text input and can be used in text input slots of other blocks.
apl.xml	APL primitives	Adds features from the APL language supporting hyperblocks.
stream-tools.xml	Streams (lazy lists)	A variation on the list data type in which each list item isn't computed until it's needed, so you can construct million-item lists without really taking up all that time or memory, or even infinite-sized lists.  (A block that reports all the prime numbers is included as an example.)  See SICP 3.5 for a tutorial.
bar-charts.xml	Bar charts	Takes a table (typically from a CSV data set) as input and reports a summary of the table grouped by the field in the specified column number.  The remaining three inputs are used only if the field values are numbers, in which case they can be grouped into buckets (e.g., decades, centuries, etc.).  Those three inputs specify the smallest and largest values of interest and, most importantly, the width of a bucket (10 for decades, 100 for centuries).  If the field isn't numeric, leave these three inputs empty or set them to zero.  In that case, each string value of the field is its own bucket, and they appear sorted alphabetically.  The block reports a new table with three columns.  The first column contains the bucket name or smallest number.  The second column contains a nonnegative integer that says how many records in the input table fall into this bucket.  The third column is a subtable containing the actual records from the original table that fall into the bucket.  If your buckets aren't of constant width, or you want to group by some function of more than one field, load the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library instead. 
httpBlocks.xml	Web services access (https)	An extended version of the URL block that allows POST, PUT, and DELETE as well as GET requests, allows using the secure HTTPS protocol, and gives control over headers, etc.  Also parses JSON data.
make-variables.xml	Create variables	Create and manage global/sprite/script variables in a script
